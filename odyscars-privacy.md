Privacy Policy for Odys Chrome Extension

Effective Date: [8.May.2025]

This privacy policy describes how the Odys Chrome Extension ("the Extension", "we", "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the extension to analyze car listings on supported websites such as www.donedeal.ie.
1. What the Extension Does

The Odys Chrome Extension enhances used car listings by displaying deal quality indicators based on statistical models. It:

    Detects car listings on supported websites.

    Sends listing URLs (publicly visible) to our prediction API.

    Displays the predicted deal rating on the page for your reference.

2. Information We Collect

We do NOT collect or store:

    Personal data (e.g., name, email, account details).

    Any data you input into the site.

    Browsing history outside supported listing pages.

We temporarily process:

    Listing URLs (e.g., /cars-for-sale/some-brand/12345678) to compute pricing predictions. These are not tied to you or your browser identity.

3. How We Use the Data

The only purpose of sending listing URLs to our backend is to:

    Generate statistical predictions of whether a car is a good deal based on comparable listings.

We do not store or share these URLs with third parties.
4. Data Retention

Our backend does not retain listing data after prediction is served. We do not maintain logs that could identify users or link them to individual listing requests.
5. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use third-party analytics, cookies, or advertising services.
6. Your Consent

By installing and using the extension, you consent to the processing of public listing data as described above.
